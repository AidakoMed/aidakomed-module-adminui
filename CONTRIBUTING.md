## Contributing
- Make sure you have cloned the OpenMRS core source code, see the getting started guide at https://wiki.openmrs.org/x/poBE
- Make sure you are the development branch that matches the openmrs version
- Fork the source code repository at https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-module-adminui
- Clone the repository from your fork, make sure you can build the project successfully.
- Claim a ticket to work on from https://issues.openmrs.org/browse/TRUNK-4748?jql=labels%20%3D%20adminui, be sure to select a ticket whose status is 'Ready for Work'
- Create a branch with the name matching the ticket number e.g RA-150
- After committing th your changes to your branch, push the code to your fork.
- Create a pull request, refer to our pull requests tips at https://wiki.openmrs.org/x/KYOfAw
- Another developer will review your code and possibly add some comments that you might need to address otherwise if all is well they will go ahead to merge and close your pull request, note that if you are required to make more changes, you DO NOT have to create a new pull request, you can always commit and push to the same branch and github will automatically update your original pull request as long it isn't yet merged and not yet closed.
- Once your code has been merged and the pull request has been closed, you can delete your working branch from your local repository and fork.
